1
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:06,090
Hello?

2
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,170
Hello?

3
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,020
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,330
Go get him.

5
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,670
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,040
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,240
He looks like a slopper to me.

8
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,210
I could use some help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,940
Hey, we got a runner!

10
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,570
Take it all in.

11
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,770
He's all yours.

12
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,950
Hey.

13
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,250
Hey there, Green Bean.

14
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,760
You're not gonna run again. Okay?

15
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,430
Good.

16
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,440
My name is Alby.

17
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,380
Can you tell me anything
about yourself? Who you are?

18
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,480
Where you came from? Anything at all.

19
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,610
No.

20
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,420
Can you tell me your name?

21
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,930
I can't remember anything.

22
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,290
- Why can't I remember anything?
- It's okay.

23
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,600
Hey, relax.

24
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:26,960
Relax.

25
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,500
It's normal.

26
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,270
It happens to us all.

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,480
You'll get your name back
in a day or two.

28
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,080
It's the one thing they let us keep.

29
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,490
What is this place?

30
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,730
Let me show you.

31
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,740
We eat here.

32
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,240
We sleep here.

33
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,380
We grow our own food.
We build our own shelter.

34
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,040
Whatever we need, the Box provides.
The rest is up to us.

35
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,380
The Box?

36
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,090
Yeah. It's sent up once a month
with fresh supplies and a new Greenie.

37
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,850
This month that's you.

38
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,330
Congratulations.

39
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:25,190
Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?

40
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,660
That, we don't know.

41
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,240
Hey, are you all right, Alby?

42
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,060
Green Bean, meet Newt.

43
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,000
When I'm not around, he's in charge.

44
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,820
It's a good thing you're
always around then.

45
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,000
That was some dash you made earlier.

46
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,050
For a second, I thought
you had the chops to be a runner...

47
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,850
till you face-planted.

48
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,310
That was great.

49
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,380
Wait, a "runner"?

50
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,110
Newt, do me a favor. Go find Chuck.

51
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,560
- All right.
- Thanks.

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,630
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

53
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,890
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

54
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,540
We got something special planned tonight.

55
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,860
Yeah. You'll see.

56
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,570
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

57
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,770
Let's go. Come on.

58
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,150
This is all we got.

59
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,150
We've worked hard for it.

60
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,120
If you respect this place...

61
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,820
you and I will get along just fine.

62
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,490
What's out there?

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,700
We only have three rules.

64
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,270
First, do your part.

65
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,950
No time for any freeloaders.

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,780
Second, never harm another Glader.

67
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,350
None of this works unless we have trust.

68
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,450
Most importantly...

69
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,890
never go beyond those walls.

70
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,660
Do you understand me, Greenie?

71
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,400
Hey, Alb'!!!

72
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,960
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

73
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,240
It's basically the same story
for all of us.

74
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,480
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

75
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,980
then here we are.

76
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,820
Don't worry.

77
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,360
You're already doing better than I did.

78
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,320
I clunked my pants three times
before they got me out of the pit.

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,460
No, come on.

80
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,010
Dude, where are you going?

81
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,540
I just wanna see.

82
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,780
You can look around all you want
but you better not go out there.

83
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,410
Why not? What's through there?

84
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,220
I don't know. I just know what I'm told.

85
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,410
And we're not supposed to leave.

86
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,030
Hey, Chuck. New Greenie?

87
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,330
How does it feel to be promoted?

88
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,770
Feels great, Ben.

89
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,330
I thought no one was allowed to leave.

90
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,270
I said we're not allowed to leave.

91
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,780
They're different, they're runners.
They know more about the maze than anyone.

92
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,140
Wait, what?

93
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,540
What?

94
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,580
What? You just said "maze."

95
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,550
I did?

96
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,740
Yeah.

97
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,130
Where are you going? What are you doing?

98
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,490
I'm just gonna take a look.

99
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,730
I told you, you can't.
No one leaves, especially not now.

100
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,160
It's not safe.

101
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,730
Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.

102
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,540
Hey!

103
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,220
We gotta stop meeting like this, Greenie.

104
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,750
- Get off me!
- All right! Calm, calm, calm.

105
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,590
- Don't touch me!
- Take it easy!

106
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,810
Just relax.

107
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,620
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

108
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,820
Just calm down, all right?

109
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,950
No, okay?
Why won't you tell me what's out there?

110
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,560
- We're just trying to protect you.
- It's for your own good.

111
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,720
You guys can't just keep me here.

112
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,830
- I can't let you leave.
- Why not?

113
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,750
What the hell?

114
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,370
Next time, I'm gonna let you leave.

115
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,680
Welcome to the Glade.

116
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,560
Light him up!

117
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,820
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

118
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,700
Here.

119
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,370
Put some hair on your chest.

120
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,810
Oh, my God! What is that?

121
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,690
I don't even know.

122
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,450
It's Gally's recipe.

123
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,890
It's a trade secret.

124
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,670
Yeah, he's still an asshole.

125
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,300
He saved your life today.

126
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,840
Trust me. The maze is a dangerous place.

127
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,750
We're trapped here, aren't we?

128
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,650
For the moment.

129
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,580
But...

130
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,090
you see those guys?

131
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,990
There, by the fire?

132
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,560
Those are the runners.

133
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,700
That guy in the middle there,
that's Minho.

134
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,300
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

135
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,140
Every morning, when those doors open,
they run the maze...

136
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,610
mapping it, memorizing it,
trying to find a way out.

137
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,970
How long have they been looking?

138
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,210
Three years.

139
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:29,150
And they haven't found anything?

140
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,320
It's a lot easier said than done.

141
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,150
Listen.

142
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,420
Hear that?

143
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,730
It's the maze, changing.

144
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,900
It changes every night.

145
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,840
How is that even possible?

146
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,000
You can ask the people who put us in here,
if you ever meet the bastards.

147
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,850
Listen, the truth is...

148
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:02,110
the runners are the only ones
who really know what's out there.

149
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,490
They are the strongest
and the fastest of us all.

150
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,550
And it's a good thing, too...

151
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,690
because if they don't make it back
before those doors close...

152
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,290
then they are stuck out there
for the night.

153
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,430
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

154
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,470
What happens to them?

155
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,410
We call them Grievers.

156
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:33,310
Of course, no one's ever seen one
and lived to tell about it.

157
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,880
But they're out there.

158
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,830
Right, that's enough questions
for one night. Come on.

159
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,560
You're supposed to be the guest of honor.

160
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:51,900
No! No, come on.
Let me show you around.

161
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,800
Come on.

162
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,050
And there we got the builders.

163
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,580
They're very good with their hands...

164
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,640
but not a lot going on upstairs.

165
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,810
And then we got Winston...

166
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,990
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

167
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,590
And we got two med-jacks, Clint and Jeff.

168
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,390
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, Newt.

169
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,550
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

170
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,630
What if I want to be a runner?

171
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,760
Have you listened to a word I've just said?
No one wants to be a runner.

172
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,890
And, besides, you gotta get chosen.

173
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,230
Chosen by who?

174
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,740
What do you say, Greenie?

175
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,580
Wanna see what you're made of?

176
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,520
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

177
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,230
Okay. All right.

178
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,110
The rules are simple, Greenie.

179
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,470
I try to push you out of the circle...

180
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,770
you try to last more than five seconds.

181
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,970
Take it easy on the Greenie.

182
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,040
Ready?

183
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,550
Get up, boy.

184
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,990
Come on, Greenie. We're not done yet.

185
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,190
Stop calling me Greenie.

186
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,490
Stop calling you that?

187
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,890
What do you wanna be called? Shank?

188
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,640
What do you think, boys?
Does he look like a Shank?

189
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,030
Come on!

190
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,310
You know what?
I think I've settled on Shank.

191
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,520
There you go, Greenie!

192
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,360
Not bad for a Greenie, huh?

193
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Thomas.

194
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,130
Thomas. Hey!

195
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,470
Thomas!

196
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,420
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

197
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Thomas!

198
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,680
Welcome home, Thomas.

199
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,000
Good job... Thomas.

200
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,380
What the hell was that?

201
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,850
That, my friend, was a Griever.

202
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,150
Don't worry, you're safe here with us.

203
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,290
Nothing gets through those walls.

204
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,020
All right, guys.

205
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:08,230
Let's tuck it in for the night. Come on.

206
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,790
It was a good night.

207
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,270
Good job, man.

208
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,890
<i>You're safe here with us.</i>

209
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

210
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,330
<i>What's out there?</i>

211
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,070
<i>Thomas, Thomas.</i>

212
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,710
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

213
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,610
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

214
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,810
Thomas.

215
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,990
Follow me.

216
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,690
It's peaceful, isn't it?

217
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,300
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

218
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,900
We had dark days.

219
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,740
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

220
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,540
To panic.

221
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,880
We've come far since then.

222
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,940
Established order...

223
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,250
made peace.

224
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,460
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

225
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,060
Because you're not like the others.

226
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,190
You're curious.

227
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,630
But you're one of us now.

228
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,900
You need to know what that means.

229
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,990
What happened to them?

230
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,300
Like I said...

231
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,560
dark days, Thomas.

232
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,010
Has anyone tried climbing to the top?

233
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,150
Tried it. The ivy doesn't go all the way
to the top.

234
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,050
Besides, where are you gonna go from there?

235
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,090
And what about the Box?
Next time it comes up...

236
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,690
No, we tried that.

237
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,920
The Box won't go back down
with someone in it.

238
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,470
- Okay, what if we...
- No, we tried it, all right?

239
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,760
Twice.

240
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,670
All right? Trust me.
Anything you think of, we've already tried.

241
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,770
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

242
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,540
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

243
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,870
Here. Go dig us up
some more fertilizer.

244
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:23,050
"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."

245
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,200
"Are you sure, guys?
I can't help in any other way?"

246
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,490
"No, just get the fertilizer."

247
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,360
"You know where it is.
It's just out in the middle of the woods."

248
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,510
You're Ben, right?

249
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,350
I don't know if we ever...

250
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,580
Are you okay?

251
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,520
Get the hell off me!

252
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,450
It's your fault.

253
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,030
I saw you.

254
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,530
You did this.

255
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,070
I saw you!

256
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,950
Hey! Hey!

257
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,290
Hey!

258
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,930
Help!

259
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,500
Help! Help!

260
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,200
Help!

261
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,380
I'll kill you!

262
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,290
Hold him down.

263
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,920
What are you doing?

264
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,520
Calm down, Ben.

265
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,850
What the hell happened?

266
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,090
- He just attacked me!
- Are you okay?

267
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,560
Calm down, Ben.

268
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,190
No. No.

269
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,490
Lift his shirt.

270
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,630
Lift his shirt.

271
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:47,700
No! No!

272
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,600
No! no!

273
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,010
Please. Please.

274
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,480
He's been stung.

275
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,340
In the middle of the day?

276
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,980
Help me, please.

277
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,950
Please. Please, just help.

278
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,610
Put him in the pit.

279
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,130
Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

280
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,180
No!

281
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,420
- Med-jack!
- Please don't do it!

282
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,260
Calm down, Ben.

283
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,630
Back down, Ben.

284
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,730
Listen to me! Please!

285
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,060
Please, stop, please!

286
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,540
He did this!

287
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,470
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

288
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,340
<i>So what happened to him?</i>

289
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,880
It's called "The Changing."

290
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,020
it's what happens
when someone gets stung.

291
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,980
Listen.

292
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,530
We haven't been able to get a clear word
out of Ben since it happened.

293
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,100
He's not making any sense.

294
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,360
And it's only gonna get worse.

295
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,500
The infection is spreading.
He's dangerous.

296
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,070
What did he say to you?

297
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,220
He said he saw me...

298
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,450
and that this was all my fault.

299
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,030
How could this be my fault?

300
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,740
Get some rest.

301
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,610
- Alby?
- Yeah.

302
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,810
What's gonna happen to him?

303
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,030
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

304
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,720
Please, Minho!

305
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,030
Alby!

306
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,100
No, please. Please, don't.

307
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,760
Please, don't do it.

308
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,340
Poles!

309
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,920
Move in!

310
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,990
No, no, no! Please!

311
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,600
No, please! Please, don't!

312
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,670
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

313
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,630
Please, stop, please!

314
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,870
- Push him in!
- Stop!

315
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,880
I'll get better!

316
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,410
He belongs to the maze now.

317
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,160
Do you think he might make it?

318
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,990
Ben?

319
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,330
No.

320
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,400
No one survives a night in the maze.

321
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,440
We just gotta forget about him.

322
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,710
<i>Thomas.</i>

323
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,770
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

324
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,040
<i>Don't make it easy on them.</i>

325
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,950
<i>Thomas.</i>

326
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,780
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

327
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,150
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

328
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,760
<i>This is gonna hurt a little.</i>

329
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,090
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

330
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,820
<i>Thomas, you have to choose.</i>

331
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,360
But why would Alby go into the maze?

332
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,860
I mean, he's not a runner.

333
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,620
Things are different now.

334
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:23,070
Alby went to retrace Ben's footsteps
before sundown.

335
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,260
Are you gonna help?

336
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,370
So he's gonna go back
to where Ben was just stung...

337
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,930
Alby knows what he's doing...

338
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,170
all right?

339
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,330
He knows better than any of us.

340
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,300
What does that mean?

341
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,280
It's like you have heard, yeah?

342
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,420
Every month,
the Box sends up a new arrival.

343
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,750
But someone had to be first, right?

344
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,430
Someone had to have spent
a whole month in the Glade, alone.

345
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,930
That was Alby.

346
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,590
I mean, it can't have been easy.

347
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,710
But when those other boys started
coming up, one after the other...

348
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
he saw the truth.

349
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,240
And he learned
that the most important thing...

350
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
is that we all have each other.

351
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,280
Because we're all in this together.

352
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,890
Yeah.

353
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,630
There you go, Greenie.

354
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,660
They should be back by now.

355
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,530
What happens if they don't make it?

356
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,600
They're gonna make it.

357
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,840
What happens if they don't?

358
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,400
They're gonna make it.

359
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,640
Come on, guys,
can't we send someone after them?

360
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,440
That's against the rules.

361
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,180
Either they make it back or they don't.

362
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,120
We can't risk losing anyone else.

363
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,500
Oh, no.

364
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,830
There!

365
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,500
Wait, somethings wrong.

366
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,110
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

367
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:21,240
Come on! Go!

368
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,180
Come on, you can make it!

369
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,910
Minho, you gotta leave him!

370
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,720
They're not gonna make it.

371
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,780
You gotta leave him!

372
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,200
Thomas, no!

373
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,480
Good job.

374
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,150
You just killed yourself.

375
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,120
What?

376
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,210
What happened to him?

377
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,440
What does it look like?

378
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,910
He got stung.

379
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,920
What happened to his head?

380
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,550
I did what I had to do.

381
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,670
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

382
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,210
We gotta go.
The maze is already changing.

383
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,710
Hey, Minho!

384
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,710
We can't just leave him here.

385
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,930
We gotta get him up.

386
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,400
Come on.

387
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:39,140
Just sit him down. Sit him down.

388
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,530
This isn't going to work. We gotta go.

389
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,830
We gotta go!

390
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:58,300
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

391
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,600
- Where?
- I don't know.

392
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,200
Are you telling me there's not
a single place we could take him?

393
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:06,780
Listen to me, shuck-face, all right.

394
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:10,280
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

395
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,240
You don't get it.

396
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,590
We're already dead.

397
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,670
Two, three...

398
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,340
Two, three...

399
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,390
Okay.

400
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,060
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

401
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,700
What are you doing?

402
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,640
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

403
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,570
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

404
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,740
Minho, stay with me.

405
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,380
Stay with me, Minho.

406
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,040
Just a little more, we're almost there.

407
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,710
- I'm sorry, Greenie.
- What?

408
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,850
Minho!

409
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,330
Okay.

410
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,140
Come on.

411
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,740
Oh, shit!

412
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,540
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

413
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,910
Come on, follow me. Come on!

414
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,390
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

415
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,760
This section is closing. Come on.

416
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,550
We can lose it down here!

417
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,290
Thomas!

418
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,960
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

419
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,000
Come on!

420
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,610
Come on!

421
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,750
Come on, Thomas!
Don't look back!

422
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,010
Run!

423
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,080
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

424
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,920
Move your ass!
Let's go! Come on!

425
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,990
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

426
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,960
Thomas!

427
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,100
Guys, 98¢ "P!

428
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,280
I told you, Chuck.

429
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,480
They're not coming back.

430
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,830
Let's go.

431
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,540
No way.

432
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:42,000
Yeah!

433
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,830
Yes!

434
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,530
Yeah!

435
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,610
I got him, I got him, I got him.

436
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,550
Watch out. Easy.

437
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,610
- What happened out there?
- How did you guys make it out?

438
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,460
You saw a Griever?

439
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,590
Yeah, I saw one.

440
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,260
He didn't just see it.

441
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,400
He killed it.

442
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,000
Things are changing.

443
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:26,610
There's no denying that.

444
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,350
First, Ben gets stung in broad daylight.

445
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,620
And then Alby.

446
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,180
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

447
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,960
to go into the maze.

448
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,400
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

449
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,460
Yeah...

450
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,440
but he saved Alby's life.

451
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,740
Did he?

452
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,780
For <i>3</i> years,
we have coexisted with these things.

453
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,110
And now, you've killed one of them.

454
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,050
Who knows what that could mean for us.

455
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:06,050
What do you suggest we do?

456
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,420
He has to be punished.

457
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,560
- Come on.
- He killed a Griever!

458
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,120
Minho.

459
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,100
You were there with him.
What do you think?

460
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,500
I think...

461
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,570
in all the time we've been here...

462
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:27,610
no one has ever killed a Griever before.

463
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,780
When I turned tail and ran...

464
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,250
this dumb shank stayed behind
to help Alby.

465
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,760
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

466
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,460
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

467
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,470
I say we make him a runner.

468
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,590
A runner? What?

469
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,070
Minho, let's not jump the gun, here.

470
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:58,010
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

471
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,140
If you want to throw the newbie a parade,
that's fine.

472
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,010
Go ahead.

473
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,910
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

474
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:08,610
it is that you do not...

475
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,890
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

476
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,700
- The Box. It's coming back up.
- It shouldn't be.

477
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,410
- Newt, what do you see?
- Do you see it?

478
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,550
It's a girl.

479
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:47,050
No way.

480
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,760
I think she's dead.

481
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:55,070
What's in her hand?

482
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,040
"She's the last one... ever."

483
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:16,620
What the hell does that mean?

484
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:21,050
Thomas...

485
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,210
Do you still think I'm overreacting?

486
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,560
Jeff, what's going on?

487
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,850
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

488
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:00,920
Hey man,
I got my job the same way you did.

489
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,730
Do you recognize her?

490
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,730
No.

491
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:13,980
Really? Because she seemed
to recognize you.

492
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:16,970
What about the note?

493
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,980
We'll worry about the note later.

494
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,520
I think you should worry about it now.

495
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,390
We've got enough to deal with
at the moment.

496
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,190
He's right, Newt.

497
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,790
If the Box isn't coming back up,
how long do you think we can last?

498
00:46:33,150 --> 00:46:35,000
No one said that.

499
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:37,800
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

500
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,540
We'll just wait until she wakes up
and see what she knows.

501
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,140
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

502
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,640
Okay.

503
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,810
- Where are you going?
- Back into the maze.

504
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,680
Hey.

505
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,020
Hey, Thomas.

506
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,290
What is this with you? A death wish?

507
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,930
You just got out
and now you want back in?

508
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,900
Newt said that no one has ever seen a
Griever and lived to tell about it, right?

509
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,410
Minho, now we have one.

510
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,630
You're telling me
you're not even a little bit curious?

511
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,340
Not really, no.

512
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:26,550
So, what's the plan?

513
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,740
You're gonna go out
and dissect that thing all by yourself?

514
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:30,580
I will if I have to.

515
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,320
Have the other runners left yet?

516
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,550
The other runners quit this morning.

517
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,690
After Alby got stung, they're not
in any hurry to get back out there.

518
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,930
Why are you?

519
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,840
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

520
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:54,710
All right.

521
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:57,180
But you're not going back out there alone.

522
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,510
Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.

523
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,070
Will this be enough?

524
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:28,940
Okay.

525
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,900
Let's go.

526
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,430
Come on!

527
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,490
That's disgusting.

528
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:16,420
There's something in there.

529
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:19,360
You mean, besides a Griever pancake?

530
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:29,900
Whoa, what are you doing?

531
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,950
I thought you said it was dead.

532
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:49,790
- Was it a reflex?
- You hope.

533
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,360
Okay, come on.
Let's try and pull it out.

534
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,560
Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.

535
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:58,430
All right, ready? On three.

536
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,330
One, two, three!

537
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,340
- Are you okay, Fry?
- Yeah. Thanks, brother.

538
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,210
What the hell is that?

539
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,590
Interesting.

540
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:00,130
Okay, whatever it is...

541
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,130
can we take this up back at the Glade?

542
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,930
Because I don't want to meet
this guy's friends.

543
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:06,470
He's right.

544
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,300
It's getting late. Come on.

545
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,080
We found this.

546
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,820
It was inside a Griever.

547
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,620
These are the same letters
we get in our supplies.

548
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,750
Yeah.

549
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,190
Whoever put us here
obviously made the Grievers.

550
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:34,530
This is the first real clue, the first
anything, you've found in over <i>3</i> years.

551
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,090
- Right, Minho?
- Right.

552
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:40,200
Newt, we gotta go back out there.

553
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,070
Who knows where this might lead us.

554
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,840
You see what he's trying to do, right?

555
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,710
First he breaks our rules...

556
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,840
and then he tries to convince us
to abandon them totally.

557
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,390
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

558
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,850
Why now are we questioning that?

559
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:00,690
If Alby was here,
you know he'd agree with me.

560
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,920
This shank needs to be punished.

561
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,060
You're right.

562
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,870
Thomas broke the rules.

563
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,870
One night in the pit,
and no food.

564
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,640
Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?

565
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,210
Do you think that's gonna stop him
from going into the maze?

566
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:23,440
No.

567
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,110
And we can't just have non-runners running
into the maze whenever they feel like it.

568
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,710
So let's just make this official.

569
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,150
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

570
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,490
Wow.

571
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:41,560
- Gally...
- No, Fry.

572
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:50,600
Thanks, Newt.

573
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,850
Hey, where are we going?

574
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,950
You'll see.

575
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,950
It's the maze.

576
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,560
All of it.

577
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:49,160
What do you mean "all of it"?
I thought you were still mapping it.

578
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:51,870
There's nothing left to map.

579
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,170
I've run every inch of it myself.

580
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,710
Every cycle.

581
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,340
Every pattern.

582
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,540
If there was a way out,
we would have found it by now.

583
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:08,720
Why haven't you told anyone this?

584
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,880
It was Alby's call.

585
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:16,190
People needed to believe
we had a chance of getting out.

586
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,030
But maybe now...

587
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,920
we have a real chance.

588
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,660
Take a look at this.

589
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,510
About a year ago, we started exploring
these outer sections.

590
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,550
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

591
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,240
Sections 1 through 8.

592
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,210
See, the way it works,
is every night, when the maze changes...

593
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,250
it opens up a new section.

594
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:46,860
So today, Section 6 was open.

595
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:50,690
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

596
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,190
The pattern always stays the same.

597
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,400
What's so special about 7?

598
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,040
I don't know.

599
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,700
But last night,
when you killed that Griever...

600
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,610
Section 7 was open.

601
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:08,270
I think it must be where it comes from.

602
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,240
Tomorrow, you and I
are gonna take a closer look.

603
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,570
Hey!

604
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,750
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

605
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,380
- Sorry, it's just the...
- it's the girl.

606
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:19,990
Is she awake?

607
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:21,810
You could say that.

608
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,160
Chuck, what's going on?

609
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,320
Girls are awesome.

610
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:28,360
Leave me alone!

611
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,900
Watch your head!

612
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:32,800
Hey, throw one more of those things...

613
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,800
- Go away!
- We come in peace!

614
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:35,980
- What happened?
- Just duck!

615
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:37,530
I don't think she likes us very much.

616
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,520
- What do you want from me?
- We just wanna talk.

617
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:40,810
I'm warning you!

618
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,780
Take cover, y'all! Take cover!

619
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,880
Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!

620
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,680
I'm gonna come up, okay?

621
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,420
Okay.

622
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:02,030
Just me.

623
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,600
I'm coming up.

624
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:16,670
Okay, just...

625
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,110
Easy, all right?

626
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,380
Where am I?

627
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,380
What is this place?

628
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,020
Why can't I remember anything?

629
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,060
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

630
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,110
Okay?

631
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,320
Your name will come back to you
in a couple of days.

632
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:33,560
- It's the one thing that...
- Teresa.

633
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,860
What did you say?

634
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:37,090
My name.

635
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,770
It's Teresa.

636
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,170
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

637
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,140
But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?

638
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:53,280
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

639
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,610
Who are you?

640
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:00,480
I don't know.

641
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,030
I can't remember.

642
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,190
None of us here can remember anything.

643
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,730
We all woke up here
just like you did.

644
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,430
Hey, I promise...

645
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:19,370
I'm gonna take this.

646
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,470
Okay.

647
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,610
What's going on up there?

648
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,820
Is she coming down?

649
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:43,220
Listen, you guys just give
us a second, okay?

650
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:46,560
All right.

651
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:48,230
Come on.

652
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:50,800
Is this what all girls are like?

653
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:54,910
That girl is crazy.

654
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:02,550
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

655
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,350
I'm not sure.

656
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,050
Ever since you came up,
that Box hasn't gone back down.

657
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,330
I just think it's got everyone
a little worried.

658
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,060
Especially Gally.

659
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:22,540
He thinks it's my fault.

660
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,810
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

661
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,020
I remember water...

662
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,920
feeling like I was drowning.

663
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,880
These faces staring at me.

664
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,400
And this woman's voice
saying the same thing over and over.

665
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,930
"Wicked is good."

666
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:54,830
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

667
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,030
I thought they were dreams.

668
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,100
You...

669
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,250
You were there.

670
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:07,940
You were there...

671
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,990
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

672
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,950
What does it mean?

673
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:21,130
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

674
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,500
And the others don't remember anything?

675
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,630
No.

676
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,300
Why are we different?

677
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,420
These were in my pocket when I came up.

678
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:49,560
"W.C.K.D."

679
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,620
"Wicked is good."

680
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:58,870
What if we were sent here for a reason?

681
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,070
Alby.

682
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,270
We don't even know what this stuff is.

683
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,900
We don't know who sent it.

684
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,740
Or why it came up here with you.

685
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,780
For all we know,
this thing could kill him.

686
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,440
He's already dying.

687
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,510
Look at him.

688
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:21,350
How could this possibly make it any worse?

689
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,820
Come on, it's worth a try.

690
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,660
All right.

691
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,660
Do it.

692
01:00:41,030 --> 01:00:42,140
Okay.

693
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,310
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

694
01:00:46,370 --> 01:00:47,410
No!

695
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,320
Watch out!

696
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,720
Get the syringe! Let go!

697
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,200
Well, that worked.

698
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,070
Okay, from now on...

699
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,230
someone stays here and
watches him around the clock.

700
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,040
Hey.

701
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:21,820
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

702
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,860
Hey, what is your problem with me?

703
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,670
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

704
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:46,240
First Ben, then Alby...

705
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,380
and now the girl.

706
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,170
Everybody saw she recognized you.

707
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:56,610
And I'm betting you know who she is.

708
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:13,060
Gally...

709
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,730
you know we can't stay here forever, right?

710
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:40,420
Who's there?

711
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,760
It's just me.

712
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:44,630
Sorry, Chuck.

713
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,100
Here.

714
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,430
You'll run better on a full stomach.

715
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,480
Thanks, Chuck.

716
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,420
Hey, what do you got there?

717
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:17,990
Wow, that came out pretty damn good.

718
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,700
What's that for?

719
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,970
It's for my parents.

720
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,730
You remember your parents?

721
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,980
No.

722
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,970
I mean, I know I must have them.

723
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:35,540
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

724
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,550
but I can't miss them
because I don't remember them.

725
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:47,390
What do you think
you're gonna find out there tomorrow?

726
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,230
I don't know.

727
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,230
But if there's a way out, Chuck,
me and Minho are gonna find it.

728
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:04,540
Here.

729
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:12,790
Chuck, why would you give this to me?

730
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:16,920
I can't remember them anyway.

731
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,290
But maybe if you find a way out,
you can give it to them for me.

732
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:26,570
I'll let you get some sleep.

733
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:37,310
Hey, Chuck.

734
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,210
Come here.

735
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,150
Put out your hand.

736
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,730
I want you to give that to them yourself.

737
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,190
We're gonna get out of here.

738
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,460
All of us.

739
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:56,790
Okay?

740
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:58,940
I promise.

741
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,770
- Yeah.
- All right.

742
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,500
- Good night.
- Good night, buddy.

743
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,520
Big day, Greenie. Are you sure
you don't wanna sit this one out?

744
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:27,590
Come on, man. Get me out of here.

745
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,760
All right.

746
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,070
Let's go!

747
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,960
This way. Not much
further to the inner ring.

748
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:03,330
Let's go!

749
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,000
Come on! This way.

750
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:35,690
That's strange.

751
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,930
What?

752
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:39,830
Seven is not supposed to be open
for another week.

753
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,340
What the hell is this place?

754
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,140
We call them blades.

755
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,140
It's Ben's, isn't it?

756
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:13,700
Yeah.

757
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:17,310
A Griever must have pulled him down here.

758
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,450
Whoa, hey!

759
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,530
I think it's showing us the way.

760
01:07:56,170 --> 01:07:57,200
Wait, wait, wait.

761
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:58,540
What, what?

762
01:08:00,770 --> 01:08:02,680
This way. Come on.

763
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:29,010
Minho, you ever see this place before?

764
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,810
No.

765
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,340
It's just another dead end.

766
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:24,560
Are you sure about this?

767
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:29,270
Nope.

768
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:04,730
Grievers.

769
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,410
What the hell was that?

770
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,860
We gotta get out of here.

771
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:28,060
Give me the key, give me the key!

772
01:10:33,490 --> 01:10:34,700
Move, move!

773
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:43,110
We gotta go! Run, Thomas!

774
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:44,980
We're gonna get trapped!

775
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,280
Go! Go!

776
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:51,910
Go, go, go!

777
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,080
Move!

778
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,120
Minho!

779
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,100
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

780
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,870
Come on, move!

781
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:13,930
Keep going!
Keep going! Let's go!

782
01:11:15,930 --> 01:11:17,310
Go, go, go!

783
01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:33,790
Go, go, go!

784
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,300
Come on! Don't look back!

785
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,470
Come on!

786
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,670
Oh, shit!

787
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,340
There!

788
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:18,540
What the hell's going on out there?

789
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,000
What the hell you done now, Thomas?

790
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,880
We found something, a new passage.
We think it could be a way out.

791
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:24,680
- Really?
- It's true.

792
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,370
We opened a door,
something I'd never seen before.

793
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,180
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

794
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,410
Wait!

795
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,850
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

796
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,150
And you want us to go in?

797
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,850
Their way in could be our way out, Chuck.

798
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:38,360
Yeah, or there could be a dozen Grievers
on the other side.

799
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,730
The truth is, Thomas doesn't know
what he has done, as usual.

800
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:44,820
Yeah, at least I did something, Gally.
I mean, what have you done?

801
01:12:44,890 --> 01:12:46,990
Aside from hide behind these walls
all the time?

802
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,470
Let me tell you something, Greenie.

803
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,230
You've been here <i>3</i> days, all right?
I've been here <i>3</i> years!

804
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,570
Yeah, you've been here <i>3</i> years
and you're still here, Gally!

805
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:54,800
What does that tell you?

806
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:56,400
Maybe you should start doing things
a little differently.

807
01:12:56,470 --> 01:12:58,680
Maybe you should be in charge,
what about that?

808
01:12:58,740 --> 01:13:00,580
Hey, it's Alby!

809
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,110
He's awake.

810
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,520
Has he said anything?

811
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:06,750
No.

812
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:09,920
"Alb?"

813
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,160
Alby, are you all right?

814
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:23,530
Hey, Alby.

815
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,180
Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.

816
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:32,880
Do you hear me?
We could be getting out of here.

817
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,850
We can't.

818
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,250
We can't leave.

819
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:43,450
They won't let us.

820
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:45,420
What are you talking about?

821
01:13:46,050 --> 01:13:47,290
I remember.

822
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:53,390
What do you remember?

823
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,570
You.

824
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:03,310
You were always their favorite, Thomas.

825
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:05,110
Always.

826
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,710
Why did you do this?

827
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:14,090
Why did you come here?

828
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,760
Winston, what's going on?

829
01:14:25,820 --> 01:14:28,030
It's the doors. They aren't closing.

830
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:24,990
Chuck, go to the Council Hall
and start barricading the doors.

831
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:26,180
Winston, you go with him.

832
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:27,030
Got it.

833
01:15:27,090 --> 01:15:27,960
Get the others.

834
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,860
Tell them to go to the forest.
Go hide, now!

835
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,990
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

836
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,060
I'll meet you at Council Hall.

837
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,330
Let's go.

838
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:39,010
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

839
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:48,340
All right, everybody hide!

840
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,810
Teresa!

841
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,880
Come on! Run! Run!

842
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:02,490
Stay down!

843
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,660
Run!

844
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,410
Zart!

845
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,210
(He") me!

846
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,120
Go! Get to the village!

847
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,590
Go, go, go!

848
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:42,730
Stay down, stay down!

849
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,700
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

850
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,280
Alby!

851
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,340
Are you okay?

852
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,780
What's going on?

853
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,840
They're here.

854
01:16:56,910 --> 01:16:58,050
Grievers?

855
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,050
Thomas, what do we do?

856
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,560
It's got me!

857
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:14,700
Everybody, run, run, run!

858
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,500
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

859
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,750
Everyone, go, go, go!

860
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:53,140
Keep moving! Oh, shit!

861
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,910
Alby!

862
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:57,570
Get behind me!

863
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,340
Come on!

864
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:06,790
Over here, let's go!

865
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,450
Over here! Let's go! Come on!

866
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,060
Over here, come on!

867
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,490
Winston!

868
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:16,030
Get Alby inside.

869
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:18,530
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

870
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,200
Lock down the doors!

871
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:39,340
Careful.

872
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,060
Stay back, guys.

873
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:11,910
Is everyone all right?

874
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,220
Help!

875
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:16,150
.Hey, grab him' - Help! '

876
01:19:19,150 --> 01:19:20,360
Watch out!

877
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,090
Chuck!

878
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:32,330
- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!

879
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:33,770
Pull him back!

880
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:36,670
- Help!
- Chuck, don't let go!

881
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:38,340
No shit!

882
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:40,380
- Pull!
- Don't let him go!

883
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:03,870
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

884
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,940
Thanks, Alby.

885
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:09,640
Alby! Watch out!

886
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:12,940
Grab him!

887
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,680
Thomas, get them out.

888
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:22,010
Alby!

889
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,680
No!

890
01:20:23,750 --> 01:20:24,780
Thomas...

891
01:20:24,850 --> 01:20:26,520
- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!

892
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:27,820
No, Thomas, wait!

893
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,430
Thomas, wait!

894
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:39,270
Where is everybody?

895
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:41,140
Who's that over there?

896
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:49,140
Gally...

897
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,750
This is all you, Thomas!

898
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:53,720
Look around!

899
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:55,490
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

900
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,580
You heard what Alby said!

901
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:57,930
- He's one of them!
- One of who?

902
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:02,190
He's one of them, and they sent him here
to destroy everything, and now he has!

903
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:04,760
Look around, Thomas! Look around!

904
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,030
This is your fault!

905
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:07,830
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

906
01:21:07,890 --> 01:21:10,630
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

907
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,870
They sent him here, and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

908
01:21:14,930 --> 01:21:16,740
What are you talking about?

909
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,070
Maybe he's right.

910
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,010
Thomas...

911
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:25,520
I need to remember, Teresa.

912
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,410
Thomas...

913
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:28,510
Thomas!

914
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:29,650
No, don't!

915
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:32,320
Thomas!

916
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,390
Chuck, get the other syringe!

917
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:36,460
It's okay.

918
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:38,330
Thomas, I'm here.

919
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,040
<i>Who put us here?</i>

920
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:53,780
<i>That we don't know.</i>

921
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,020
<i>Teresa...</i>

922
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,880
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

923
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,060
<i>Excellent, Thomas.</i>

924
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,360
Come with me.

925
01:22:09,690 --> 01:22:10,720
Wicked isn't good.

926
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:11,820
<i>Thomas...</i>

927
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,400
Wicked is good.

928
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:15,770
<i>How could this be my fault?</i>

929
01:22:15,790 --> 01:22:17,000
<i>You did this!</i>

930
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:18,800
<i>I saw you!</i>

931
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:22,980
<i>I can't keep watching them die.</i>

932
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,490
Hey.

933
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,520
Are you okay?

934
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,950
What the hell were you thinking?

935
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,600
What happened?

936
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:46,930
Gally has taken control.

937
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,740
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

938
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:53,570
or get banished at sundown with you.

939
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:57,170
And the others agreed to that?

940
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:02,240
Gally has everyone convinced that
you're the reason all this has happened.

941
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,220
Well, he's been right so far.

942
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:10,590
What are you talking about?

943
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,060
This place...

944
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,230
it's not what we thought it was.

945
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:20,230
It's not a prison, it's a test.

946
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:23,160
It all started when we were kids.

947
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:26,940
They would give us these challenges.

948
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:30,100
They were experimenting on us.

949
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,270
And then people started disappearing.

950
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:37,250
Every month,
one after the other, like clockwork.

951
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,990
They were sending them up into the maze.

952
01:23:40,110 --> 01:23:42,320
Yeah, but not all of us.

953
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,650
What do you mean?

954
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,560
Guys, I'm one of them.

955
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,830
The people who put you here,
I worked with them.

956
01:23:56,430 --> 01:23:59,170
I watched you guys for years.

957
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,410
The entire time you have been here...

958
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,600
I was on the other side of it.

959
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:08,750
So were you.

960
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,810
What?

961
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,790
Teresa, we did this to them.

962
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,990
No.

963
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,790
That can't be true.

964
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,360
It is. I saw it.

965
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:29,800
Why would they send us up
if we were with them?

966
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:31,460
It doesn't matter.

967
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:34,280
He's right.

968
01:24:36,970 --> 01:24:38,640
It doesn't matter.

969
01:24:39,370 --> 01:24:41,110
Any of it.

970
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:46,280
Because the people we were before the maze
don't even exist anymore.

971
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:48,520
These Creators took care of that.

972
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,350
But what does matter is who we are now,
and what we do...

973
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,190
right now.

974
01:24:56,220 --> 01:24:58,930
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

975
01:24:59,190 --> 01:25:02,330
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

976
01:25:05,730 --> 01:25:07,210
Maybe.

977
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:15,720
But I know that if he were here, he would
be telling you the exact same thing.

978
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:20,080
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

979
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:23,660
Because if we do nothing...

980
01:25:23,710 --> 01:25:27,090
then that means Alby died for nothing,
and I can't have that.

981
01:25:31,390 --> 01:25:32,890
Okay.

982
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:38,160
Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.

983
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,970
This is such a waste.

984
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:15,940
Gally...

985
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:22,720
It doesn't feel right, man.

986
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:26,320
Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

987
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:29,250
Maybe he can lead us home.

988
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:33,450
We are home.

989
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:35,720
Okay?

990
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:40,060
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

991
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:43,800
You really think banishing us
is gonna solve anything?

992
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:45,910
No.

993
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,070
But this isn't a banishing.

994
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,170
It's an offering.

995
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:55,210
What? Wait!
Gally, what are you doing?

996
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:59,720
You really think I'm gonna let Thomas
back into the maze after what he has done?

997
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,480
Look around you!

998
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,190
Look at our Glade!

999
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:09,430
This is the only way.

1000
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:12,900
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1001
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:15,700
everything goes back to the way it was.

1002
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,100
Are you listening to this?

1003
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:19,640
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

1004
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:20,610
You shut up.

1005
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:23,370
If you stay here,
the Grievers are going to come back.

1006
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:25,210
They're gonna come back,
and they're gonna keep coming back...

1007
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:26,580
until you're all dead!

1008
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,450
Shut up! Tie him up!

1009
01:27:30,110 --> 01:27:32,250
Do you hear me? I said tie him up!

1010
01:27:57,170 --> 01:27:59,080
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1011
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,170
You don't have to come with us,
but we are leaving.

1012
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:04,720
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1013
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,410
Don't listen to him,
he's just trying to scare you.

1014
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:09,250
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1015
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:11,020
I'm scared.

1016
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:17,690
But I'd rather risk my life out there
than spending the rest of it in here.

1017
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,060
We don't belong here.

1018
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,400
This place isn't our home.

1019
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,000
We were put here.

1020
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,970
We were trapped here.

1021
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:32,980
At least, out there we have a choice.

1022
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,240
We can make it out of here.

1023
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,650
I know that.

1024
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:54,430
I'm sorry.

1025
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:10,580
Gally, it's over.

1026
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:15,710
Just come with us.

1027
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:25,700
Good luck against the Grievers.

1028
01:29:44,410 --> 01:29:45,980
Everybody, this way!

1029
01:30:00,060 --> 01:30:02,330
Keep it up, guys, we're almost there!

1030
01:30:16,340 --> 01:30:17,720
Is it a Griever?

1031
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:19,010
Yeah.

1032
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:21,250
Shit.

1033
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,180
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1034
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:28,860
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1035
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:32,920
Once we're through,
it will activate and the door will open.

1036
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:35,160
We stay close, we stick together...

1037
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:37,540
we get through this. We get out now...

1038
01:30:37,690 --> 01:30:39,770
or we die trying.

1039
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,870
Ready?

1040
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:45,340
All right. Let's go!

1041
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,320
Get up, look out!

1042
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,460
Push it!

1043
01:31:11,830 --> 01:31:12,830
Look out!

1044
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,110
The key!

1045
01:31:23,210 --> 01:31:24,240
Chuck!

1046
01:31:24,310 --> 01:31:25,620
Watch the edge!

1047
01:31:32,380 --> 01:31:33,380
Oh, no.

1048
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:36,800
- I got you, Chuck!
- Pull me up!

1049
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,640
Come on!

1050
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:51,580
Thomas! Thomas!

1051
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,240
Chuck?

1052
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:54,780
We got more coming!

1053
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:58,240
Keep it steady, guys!

1054
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:01,550
It works!

1055
01:32:03,380 --> 01:32:04,760
Teresa, go!

1056
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:10,160
Don't back down! Keep pushing!

1057
01:32:10,220 --> 01:32:11,490
Stay together!

1058
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,070
There's gotta be a way out! Come on!

1059
01:32:25,170 --> 01:32:26,200
Watch it!

1060
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:33,450
It won't open!

1061
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:37,680
Thomas!

1062
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:39,060
There's a code!

1063
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,490
Eight numbers!

1064
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,130
Eight sections of the maze.

1065
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:46,170
Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?

1066
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,220
What?

1067
01:32:47,290 --> 01:32:49,930
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1068
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:51,930
Seven! One!

1069
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:54,100
Five! Two!

1070
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,300
Six! Four!

1071
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:56,400
Heads up!

1072
01:32:58,770 --> 01:32:59,910
Minho!

1073
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:01,170
Minho!

1074
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:05,180
Get off of me!

1075
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,760
Jeff!

1076
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:20,020
What's the sequence? Come on!

1077
01:33:20,090 --> 01:33:21,090
Six!

1078
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:22,640
Four! Eight!

1079
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,300
Three! You got it?

1080
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:27,470
Keep holding!

1081
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,900
Almost there, come on!

1082
01:33:29,970 --> 01:33:31,340
The door opened!

1083
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,470
Seriously?

1084
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,680
What happened here?

1085
01:36:18,670 --> 01:36:20,510
So they were watching us.

1086
01:36:21,710 --> 01:36:23,340
This whole time.

1087
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,540
<i>Hello.</i>

1088
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:52,870
<i>My name is Doctor Ava Paige.</i>

1089
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:58,250
<i>I'm Director of Operations of the
World Catastrophe Killzone Department.</i>

1090
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:02,910
<i>If you're watching this, that means you have
successfully completed the Maze Trials.</i>

1091
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:06,490
<i>I wish I could be there in person
to cangratulate you...</i>

1092
01:37:08,190 --> 01:37:12,070
<i>but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.</i>

1093
01:37:12,220 --> 01:37:15,030
<i>I'm sure by now,
you must all be very confused...</i>

1094
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:16,590
<i>(a!!!)ff...</i>

1095
01:37:16,760 --> 01:37:18,260
<i>frightened.</i>

1096
01:37:18,430 --> 01:37:21,970
<i>I can only assure you,
that everything that's happened to you...</i>

1097
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:25,010
<i>everything we've done to you...</i>

1098
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:27,210
<i>it was all done for a reason.</i>

1099
01:37:27,900 --> 01:37:29,610
<i>You won't remember...</i>

1100
01:37:29,770 --> 01:37:32,520
<i>but the Sun has scorched our world.</i>

1101
01:37:34,340 --> 01:37:36,850
<i>Billions of lives lost to fire...</i>

1102
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:38,720
<i>famine...</i>

1103
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:42,200
<i>suffering on a global scale.</i>

1104
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:45,360
<i>The fallout was unimaginable.</i>

1105
01:37:46,120 --> 01:37:48,730
<i>What came after was worse.</i>

1106
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:51,200
<i>We called it the Flare.</i>

1107
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:55,680
<i>A deadly virus that attacks the brain.</i>

1108
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:57,680
<i>It is violent...</i>

1109
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,370
<i>unpredictable...</i>

1110
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,110
<i>incurable.</i>

1111
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:04,940
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

1112
01:38:06,610 --> 01:38:10,850
<i>In time, a new generation emerged
that could survive the virus.</i>

1113
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,520
<i>Suddenly, there was a reason
to hope for a cure.</i>

1114
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:18,460
<i>But finding it would not be easy.</i>

1115
01:38:18,620 --> 01:38:21,730
<i>The young would have to be tested,
even sacrificed...</i>

1116
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,230
<i>inside harsh environments...</i>

1117
01:38:24,390 --> 01:38:26,930
<i>where their brain activity
could be studied.</i>

1118
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:29,000
<i>All in an effort to understand...</i>

1119
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:31,240
<i>what makes them different...</i>

1120
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:35,280
<i>what makes you different.</i>

1121
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:38,540
<i>You may not realize it...</i>

1122
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:41,090
<i>but you're very important.</i>

1123
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,320
<i>Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.</i>

1124
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,660
<i>As you will no doubt soon discover,
not everyone agrees with our methods.</i>

1125
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:51,990
<i>Progress is slow, people are scared.</i>

1126
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,730
<i>It may be too late for us...</i>

1127
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:56,670
<i>for me...</i>

1128
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:58,200
<i>but not for you.</i>

1129
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,910
<i>The outside world awaits.</i>

1130
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,910
<i>Remember...</i>

1131
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,780
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

1132
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:45,040
Is it over?

1133
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:48,820
She said we were important.

1134
01:39:50,550 --> 01:39:52,550
What are we supposed to do now?

1135
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:02,690
I don't know.

1136
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:09,870
Let's get out of here.

1137
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:13,900
No.

1138
01:40:18,310 --> 01:40:19,880
- Gally?
- Don't.

1139
01:40:21,010 --> 01:40:22,820
He's been stung.

1140
01:40:30,420 --> 01:40:31,760
We can't leave.

1141
01:40:35,690 --> 01:40:37,760
We did. Gally, we're out.

1142
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:40,170
We're free.

1143
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:43,670
Free?

1144
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,170
You think we're free out there?

1145
01:40:50,740 --> 01:40:51,780
No.

1146
01:40:53,780 --> 01:40:56,050
No, there's no escape from this place.

1147
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:02,700
Gally, listen to me.

1148
01:41:02,850 --> 01:41:05,090
You're not thinking straight.

1149
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,890
You're not.

1150
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:09,770
Now, we can help you.

1151
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:13,300
Just put down the gun.

1152
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:15,810
I belong to the maze.

1153
01:41:15,970 --> 01:41:17,710
Just put down the gun.

1154
01:41:20,740 --> 01:41:22,150
We all do.

1155
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,270
Thomas...

1156
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:47,570
Chuck.

1157
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:54,080
Oh, shit. Shit.

1158
01:41:55,140 --> 01:41:56,780
Look at me, look at me!

1159
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:58,910
Oh, shit!

1160
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:00,720
Chuck, look at me, all right?

1161
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:02,690
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1162
01:42:02,750 --> 01:42:04,190
It's okay.

1163
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:06,020
Thomas, Thomas...

1164
01:42:11,450 --> 01:42:13,560
No, Chuck.
You're gonna give it to them yourself.

1165
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:14,690
Remember, I told you that.

1166
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,030
Take it.

1167
01:42:16,690 --> 01:42:17,800
No.

1168
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:21,430
Thank you.

1169
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,540
Thank you.

1170
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,750
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1171
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:33,680
Chuck.

1172
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:38,020
Chuck? Hey.

1173
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:41,690
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1174
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:44,260
Come on, wake up!

1175
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:53,300
Damn it!

1176
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,950
We made it. Come on.

1177
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:04,580
I"m sorry!

1178
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,180
God damn it!

1179
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:10,550
Damn it!

1180
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,960
- Thomas.
- Chuck!

1181
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,660
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1182
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:37,880
Chuck!

1183
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:41,480
You can't just leave him there!

1184
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:20,730
You guys all right?

1185
01:44:21,220 --> 01:44:22,360
Don't worry.

1186
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:23,900
You're safe now.

1187
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:02,060
Relax, kid.

1188
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:05,770
Everything is gonna change.

1189
01:45:20,610 --> 01:45:24,180
I think it's safe to say
the Maze Trials were a complete success.

1190
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:28,150
<i>I wasn't expecting so
many survivors, but...</i>

1191
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:30,820
<i>the more the merrier.</i>

1192
01:45:34,660 --> 01:45:38,400
<i>Thomas continues to surprise and impress.</i>

1193
01:45:39,730 --> 01:45:43,470
<i>And for now,
they seem to have taken the bait.</i>

1194
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,510
<i>It's too soon to say...</i>

1195
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,650
<i>but they could be the key to everything.</i>

1196
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,850
<i>So let's move forward.</i>

1197
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:59,420
It's time now to begin Phase Two.
